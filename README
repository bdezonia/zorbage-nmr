zorbage-nmr

This repository contains code for loading various NMR file formats into zorbage
structures for further processing.

Currently supported file types include:

  - nmrPipe binary formats
  - nmrPipe text-based formats

Future development directions will be to add more formats such that this
  package is like nmrglue but for zorbage backed data.
